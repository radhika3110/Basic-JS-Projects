Welcome to the collection of basic JavaScript projects! 
These projects are built using simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
As a beginner, I started learning web development by working on these foundational projects to get a strong grasp of the core concepts

**Firstly let's talk about why I am uploading basic Js Projects. This doesn't mean that I am still a beginner. Here's why:**

1. Continuous Learning: I am constantly evolving as a developer and learning new frameworks, libraries, and back-end technologies. But these projects were a part of my learning path, and I think it’s essential to showcase that journey.
2. Demonstrating Skills: Though these projects are written in basic HTML, CSS, and JS, this doesn’t mean I’m not familiar with more advanced tools like React, Node.js, or other frameworks. Sometimes, it's good to revisit the basics to reinforce core skills.
3. Growth Mindset: Uploading these projects shows that I value the learning process and am not afraid to revisit earlier stages to improve my fundamentals. It’s a part of the continuous growth that defines a true intermediate-level developer.


**Why These Projects Matter for Beginners**
For anyone starting their journey in web development, understanding the fundamentals is key. These basic JavaScript projects are important because:

1. Core Knowledge: They lay the foundation for learning more advanced concepts, helping you understand how to manipulate the DOM, handle user events, and use JavaScript logic to create interactive experiences.
2. Problem Solving: They give beginners the chance to practice problem-solving and logic development by implementing basic functionality like form validation, interactive UI elements, or simple games.
3. Building Confidence: Completing small projects gives a beginner the confidence to move on to more complex topics and frameworks.
